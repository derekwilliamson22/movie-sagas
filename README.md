### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React] (https://reactjs.org)
- React-Redux
- Redux-Saga
- Material UI
- PostGreSQL

### Installation

## Database Setup

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
2. Run the queries from file `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database.
3. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.

## Install Dependencies

1. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
2. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
3. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
4. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. Users will be automatically directed to a home page that lists all the movies in the database.
2. Clicking on a poster will direct them to a Details page where more information can be found.
3. A back button is provided to return to the main page.
4. An Add a Movie link takes the user to a form to add a film to the database (which will render in the main list).
